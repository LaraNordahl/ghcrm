*/

1. Unpack and install to [ezroot]/extension. 

2. Run the .pkz file to create proper Sales groups, permissions and custom classes.

    BEFORE:
        AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=admin2
        AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=admin

    AFTER:
        AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ghcrm
        AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=admin2
        AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=admin

5. Create a "Sales" folder somewhere in your content structure. Note the NodeID of the Sales folder. (NOT the Object ID).
Set the RootNode to the node id number in ghcrm/settings/content.ini undeer the [CRMNodeSettings] section.
/* may see if we can create the sales folder one level higher so it doesn't look like content for the website */

6. Clear your caches (ezcache.php --clear-all --purge)

7. Regenerate autoload arrays (ezpgenerateautloads.php --extension)

8. Make sure the user group you intend to use has access to ezjscore::GHCRMFetch::getDataSet if you use the Sales group and not just the administrator account.

/* CRM Email */

    *** Note: Identifier names have to be exact. ***

    -  Go to the Setup Tab in eZ Publish -> Workflows. (See send_email_workflow.jpg & send_email_multiplexer_workflow.jpg)
    *** Note: Workflows have to be exact for email to send. ***

3. Add a trigger.
    - Go to the Setup Tab in eZ Publish -> Triggers (workflows must be set up first)
    - Select Multiplexer from the dropdown. (content/publish/after)

/* Steps to send CRM Email */
